# 🏴‍☠️ Web3 Pirates

**Hack the Future, Port to Port**

We are a collective of developers, designers, and dreamers from the gorilli.io team and friends who travel the world to build at hackathons, one project, one experiment, one community at a time.

## 🌍 What We Do

- Build prototypes at global hackathons
- Collaborate with open-minded builders
- Explore the edges of Web3 tech, from DeFi to identity
- Share everything in the open, on-chain or off

## 🛠️ Projects

Explore our growing list of experiments, built across:

- ETHGlobal events
- Local Web3 meetups
- Online builder jams

## 🤝 Join the Crew

We’re always looking for passionate pirates to build with.
Follow the repo, open a PR, or meet us at the next hackathon.

> No gatekeeping. Just building.
